############ INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE OPL CODE IN CPLEX #############





################ INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE HEURISTICS ################
On the Heuristics folder you will find two folders: Heuristics and InstanceGenerator.

- Heuristics contains the code to run the heuristic solvers: Greedy, local search and GRASP.
- InstanceGenerator contains the code to generate the instances.


### HOW TO GENERATE INSTANCES ###

To generate new instances, go to /InstanceGenerator/config/ and open the config.dat file. Inside this file,
you can modify the parameters as you want.

Once you are done with config.dat file, just run the /InstanceGenerator/Main.py file to generate the instances.
You will find the instances inside InstanceGenerator/output folder.


### HOW TO RUN THE HEURISTIC SOLVERS WITH THE NEW GENERATED INSTANCES ###

First, copy the previously generated instances to the /Heuristics/data/ folder.

Then open the /Heuristics/config/config.dat file, and modify the parameters as you want. The structure
is the same as the one from the lab sessions, so you shouldn't have any problem.

Once you have selected the solver you want to use, run the /Heuristics/Main.py file and wait until it ends.

The solution file will be inside the /Heuristics/solutions/ folder.
